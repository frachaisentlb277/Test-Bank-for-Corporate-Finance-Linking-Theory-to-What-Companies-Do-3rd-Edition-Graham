  * Connect the latest financial theories to what today's organizations and CFOs are actually practicing in business with Graham/Smart/Megginson's CORPORATE FINANCE: LINKING THEORY TO WHAT COMPANIES DO, 3E. This business-focused, accessible text is more relevant than ever as award-winning author and nationally acclaimed finance researcher John Graham of Duke University, joins master-teacher Scott Smart and international business expert Bill Megginson to help bridge the gap between academic rigor and corporate finance practices. This edition integrates the latest from Duke University's CFO Global Business Outlook, a quarterly survey of financial executives that gauges business outlook and topical economic issues. The authors have refined this practical, accessible text to correspond with the way you teach your MBA-level course. Engaging examples, meaningful cases, and practical exercises reflect how changing events and recent financial crises relate to established finance principles. Cross-functional applications and career success features, such as actual job interview questions in the margins, make the book applicable to both finance majors and general business professionals. Time-saving online Smart Finance tools further reinforce learning with integrated tutorials, interactive practice, and videos from leading finance researchers introducing the latest theories and concepts.
